# News Today

USING THE NEWS API, READ TODAY'S TOP HEADLINES IN YOUR COUNTRY.

You should first get your api-key. Visit newsapi.org.

replace my api-key with yours in main_url.

get the requests module.

pip install requests.

you can change the period of news using 'from=' and 'to=' in main_url.

to get the most popular articles first: add a parameter 'sortBy=popularity' in the 'main_url'.

I will upload the v2/everything code soon.
